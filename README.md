# hashcrust: A Library for adding that extra special crust to your MD5 hash.

Implementation Steps:
- [ ] Given two jpg (or png?) files, output modified versions with same MD5 hash using easy prefix
- [ ] Output modified files with same MD5 hash by calling into hashclash
- [ ] Implement collision strategies in rust, going piece by piece through interesting parts of HashClash
- [ ] Benchmark efficiency changes between calling into HashClash/native Rust version.
